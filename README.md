# My Cool SVG Maker
  ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
 
  ## Description
  The motivation for building this app was to generate an SVG logo from user prompts. This allows you to make a cool basic SVG logo quickly which will save you time. I learned how I was overcomplicating testing when I was in class.

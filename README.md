# My Cool SVG Maker
  ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
 
  ## Description
  The motivation for building this app was to generate an SVG logo from user prompts. This allows you to make a cool basic SVG logo quickly which will save you time. I learned how I was overcomplicating testing when I was in class.

  ## Installation
  You must install Inquirer 8.2.4 and Jest 29.5.0.
 
  ## Usage
  After cloning the repository, you must run "npm i -s" in your terminal. This will download the needed software. After that you run "node index.js" in the terminal and answer the prompts for the logo you want to create. If you want to preview the SVG logos you have made and you are on VS Code as your IDE, you can download and extension called "SVG Preview" to view them or you can put the resulting output in the body of an HTML file. To do testing, you run "npm test" in the terminal and it will show you that it passes all three tests.
